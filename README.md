# Luxury Code Base

As this project is now permanently closed/stopped, I've decided to release the source code, with the aim of allowing people to learn from it.

Luxury, LuxuryNitro, LuxuryBoosts were a set of services linked with Discord.

If you have any questions, make an issue on this repo, or join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bjzADG4C4s).

These projects are not really designed to be "plug 'n' play". You can attempt to run them for yourself, however I will not be providing extensive support for it.

Pull requests editing code will not be accepted. However, if you want to make a PR adding more documentation or images, please feel free.

## Terminology
- Nitro Sniping
    - Bots watching public chat channels for Nitro Gift links, and redeeming them on an account within milliseconds.
    - You can obtain Nitro cheaper this way.
- Fake Members
    - Bot accounts joining a Discord Server, to elevate it's member count. Can be offline, or online.
    - Makes the server (at first glance) seem more popular than it is.
- Boosting Service
    - Allows the user to have their server (Nitro) boosted by bots, to get to a higher level, and get the entire server perks (like a vanity invite link).
    - Cheaper this way, than buying Nitro/Boosts.
